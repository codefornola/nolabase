Welcome to the nolabase! The nolabase is a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database containing all public information
about the city of New Orleans. It's a community run service provided by [Code For New Orleans](https://codeforneworleans.org/).
It's used by community members performing analysis to better help them understand the city and 
do their advocacy. It's also a platform to build tools and applications that help the community.

:::warning
This is still very much a Work-In-Progress and things will change rapdily at first.
If you want to use the nolabase for something mission critical, please reach out to the community
first.
