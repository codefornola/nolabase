The most common way to interact with any SQL database is to use a SQL IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

With a SQL IDE, you write SQL and get back result rows. You can then export these rows to CSV or other forms
to import into another tool. Although this is not always the best tool for doing analysis, it's a good
tool to have so you can explore the data and debug your SQL queries. Some IDEs give you the ability to
make simple charts or visualizations from the results, but you won't get much control over it and you
likely won't be able to do complicated things like maps.

Here's what we recommend for IDEs:

## Sqlelectron (Beginner)

For an easy and user-friendly option, we recommend [sqlectron](https://sqlectron.github.io/).
It's free, open source, and it works on all operating systems.

### Setup

After opening the application, hit `Add` and fill out the following details:

Use the `Test` button to test your configuration. And hit `Save` when you confirm it works. As always, if you
have any trouble come to the Slack channel for help.

## DataGrip (Advanced)

If you are looking for a better option and are willing to pay for it, we recommend using [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/).
