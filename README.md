# Nolabase

The nolabase is a postgres database containing all public information about the city of New Orleans.
This respository contains all of the tools to manage the database as well as the code to scrape the data sources.

> *Warning* This is still very much a WIP and things will change. So please do not spread to the community until we have
> established some interfaces that we can support long term.

## Goals

1. Help the community answer questions about the city
2. Liberate public data from walled gardens (e.g. see the [Tax Assessor dataset](./internal/datasources/assessor/README.md))

We hope the nolabase is not just a tool, but a community. By making it easy to use and
providing a single interface to query the data, we hope that disparate members of the community can help
each other with their analysis rather than doing the same work over and over again in silos.

## Questions
